# E-commerce Product Page

The "E-commerce Product Page" project aims to develop a dynamic product detail page for an e-commerce website. The project involves creating a model for products with attributes such as name, description, price, and image. Product details are dynamically displayed on a dedicated product page. An "Add to Cart" button is implemented using Django sessions for users to add products to their shopping cart. Additionally, a review section is included where authenticated users can leave feedback.
